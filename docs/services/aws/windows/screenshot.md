# Windows screenshots

To take a screenshot in Windows, you have several options:

1. **Using Snipping Tool**: Press `Windows logo key + Shift + S` to open the Snipping Tool. Choose from options like rectangular, freehand, window, or full-screen capture. The screenshot is copied to your clipboard and can be pasted into another app.

2. **Using Print Screen Key**: 
   - To capture an active window: Press `ALT + Print Screen`, then paste into an app.
   - To capture the entire screen: Press `Print Screen`, then paste into an app.
   - To save the screenshot as an image file: Press `Windows + Print Screen`. Find your screenshot in PNG format in the Pictures > Screenshots folder.

To take a screenshot of a selection on Windows and save it directly to the "Pictures" -> "Screenshots" folder, you can use the built-in Snip & Sketch tool. Here are the steps:

1. **Open Snip & Sketch**:
   - Press `Windows key + Shift + S`. This opens the Snip & Sketch tool in snipping mode.
   - Alternatively, you can search for "Snip & Sketch" in the start menu and open the application.

2. **Select the Area**:
   - Once you press `Windows key + Shift + S`, your screen will dim, and you'll see a small toolbar at the top of your screen. Choose the type of snip you want to make (rectangular, freeform, window, or fullscreen).
   - For a selection, use the rectangular snip or freeform snip. Click and drag to select the area of your screen that you want to capture.

3. **Save the Screenshot**:
   - After making the selection, the screenshot will be copied to your clipboard and a notification will appear in the lower right corner. Click on the notification to open the Snip & Sketch editor.
   - In the Snip & Sketch editor, click on the save button (a floppy disk icon) or press `Ctrl + S`.
   - Navigate to the "Pictures" -> "Screenshots" folder in the save dialog and save your screenshot there.

Note that by default, when you use the `PrtScn` key or the `Windows key + PrtScn`, Windows saves the screenshots in the "Pictures" -> "Screenshots" folder automatically. However, these methods capture the entire screen or window, not a selection.

Using Snip & Sketch with the `Windows key + Shift + S` shortcut allows for selecting a specific area but requires you to manually save the screenshot in the desired folder.
