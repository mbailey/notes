# Backups

[Apps/DejaDup - GNOME Wiki! (wiki.gnome.org)](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DejaDup)

Trying out the **automated incremental remote backup tool** included with Gnome.

Seems pretty good so far. It's a rebranded `deja-dup` which itself is a GUI for the CLI tool [`duplicity`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/duplicity).
If I like it I'll learn to configure duplicity when I have the time for that.
