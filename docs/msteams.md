# Microsoft Teams

## [Teams Web App on Fedora](https://teams.microsoft.com/)

On fedora-36, I had to install [Google Chrome](chrome.md) to get video and screen sharing to work.


## Notes

- Run two copies of Teams as Progressive Web Apps in Chrome.
- Make use of Desktop entries with different icons to start and swap between them.
