### Lint

[Python-Markdown requires 4 spaces for list indentation](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/issues/1204)

> Sorry, but the quote from Gruber's rules which is contained in our
> explanation...
>
> >     each subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4
> >      spaces or one tab
>
> ... can only be interpreted one way by me. Nothing will persuade me
> otherwise. Gruber simply failed to follow his own rule in his implementation.
> I have not made that mistake and never will. End of discussion.
>
> That said, you are free to implement your own behavior in an
> extension/fork/clone/whatever.
