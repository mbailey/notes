# Markdown

- [Daring Fireball Markdown Syntax Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
 
## Editing

- [obsidian](obsidian.md): Cross Platform, WYSIWYG, extensive plugins (tables, calendar, etc)
- [vscode](vscode.md): Cross Platform, Live Preview, Syntax Highlighting, Linting, Plugins
- vim: Cross Platform, Terminal, Syntax Highlighting, Linting
- [GitHub.com](https://github.com): Web App


## Web Clipping

- [Markdownload : A Firefox and Google Chrome extension to clip websites and download them into a readable markdown file.](https://github.com/deathau/markdownload) (github.com/deathau)
    - It's a bit buggy - including `moz-extension` in copied links *sometimes*

## Formatting

- Headings may be folded in some editors/viewers ([obsidian](obsidian.md))

### Lint

[Python-Markdown requires 4 spaces for list indentation](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/issues/1204)

> Sorry, but the quote from Gruber's rules which is contained in our
> explanation...
>
> >     each subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4
> >      spaces or one tab
>
> ... can only be interpreted one way by me. Nothing will persuade me
> otherwise. Gruber simply failed to follow his own rule in his implementation.
> I have not made that mistake and never will. End of discussion.
>
> That said, you are free to implement your own behavior in an
> extension/fork/clone/whatever.
