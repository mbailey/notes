## Sync

Tools for Sync'ing:

- [SyncThing](https://syncthing.net/) is free and works well between computers. Data stays on your hardware.
- [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync): USD $10 per month. Supports end to end encryption.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Open Source and free source control.

### Note

- Sync conflicts will likely result from using Obsidian Sync with another type (like SyncThing).
  - Setting "Open Daily Note at Startup" to true on multiple hosts will likely cause sync issues. [forum.obsidian.com](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-sync-updates-from-one-device-overwritten-by-another/33007)

## Multiple Vaults

I'd prefer to have multiple vaults open instead of having to keep switching.
