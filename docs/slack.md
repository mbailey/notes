### Set your preference for one-click emoji reactions

One-click emoji reactions let you respond to messages in Slack almost instantly â€“ simply hover over a message and choose from three emoji options. Owners and admins can choose default one-click reactions that you see, but you can customise them using the steps below.

    From your desktop, click on your profile picture in the top right.
    Select Preferences from the menu.
    Select Messages & media.
    Under Emoji, tick or untick the box next to Show one-click reactions on messages. If ticked, click the boxes to select three emoji.
