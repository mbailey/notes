# Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a versioning scheme that uses a three-part version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to convey meaning about the underlying changes between releases. This helps developers manage dependencies and understand the potential impact of updating to newer versions. [Learn more](https://semver.org/)
