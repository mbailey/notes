# Volkswagen

Volkswagen was ==established in 1937== by the German Labour Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront) in Berlin. In the early 1930s, ==cars were a luxury== – most Germans could afford nothing more elaborate than a motorcycle and ==only one German out of 50 owned a car==. Seeking a potential new market, some car makers began independent "people's car" projects – the Mercedes 170H, BMW 3/15, Adler AutoBahn, Steyr 55, and Hanomag 1.3L, among others.
