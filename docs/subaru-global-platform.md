- Started in 2016
- As of 2021, SGP underpins all of the vehicles built and sold by Subaru.

The **Subaru Global Platform** (スバルグローバルプラットフォーム), abbreviated as **SGP**, is the modular [unibody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_frame#Unibody "Vehicle frame") [automobile platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_platform "Automobile platform") for nearly all models manufactured by [Subaru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru "Subaru"), ==starting with the [fifth-generation Subaru Impreza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Impreza#fifth "Subaru Impreza") in 2016== .

The primary dynamic benefits of SGP compared to prior Subaru platforms were:
- improved strength
- increased rigidity
- a lowered center of gravity

In addition, moving to a common platform made production more flexible and efficient; existing production lines could shift to meet demand by producing different models without significant reconfiguration, and common parts could be reused between models.

==As of 2021, SGP underpins all of the vehicles built and sold by Subaru.== The [WRX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_WRX "Subaru WRX"), debuted its second generation on September 10, 2021 for model year 2022. The WRX was the last model to move to the SGP.
