Ideas for Working From Outdoors.

## General Considerations

- Laptop
    - switch off system "dark mode"
        - configure your apps to adapt to system
    - use one with a bright screen?
    - large enough display

- glare / reflection
    - choose a dark/shaded background to reduce contrast around screen
    - avoid light source (e.g. sun or bright reflective surface) behind
