## git filter-repo

git filter-repo ([github][1]) is a versatile tool for rewriting history. It is now recommended by the git project instead of git filter-branch.

git-filter-repo is a single-file python script, which was done to make installation for basic use on many systems trivial: just place the script into your $PATH.
