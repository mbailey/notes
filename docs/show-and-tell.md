# show and tell

Show and Tell is a chance to share something interesting with your team.

You may have done it in primary school. The format is something like:

- presenters wait in queue for their turn to present
- each presenter has a fixed time (~3min) to present to the group
- [optional] fixed time for questions (~2min)
- audience shows appreciation and next presenter starts

It can be anything some ideas to get you started include:

- Cool tricks!
- Something you learned
- Something you use

## Cool Tricks!

- Something neat you can do
- You don't have to have invented it

## Something You Learned

- It doesn't have to be your original discovery
- It doesn't matter if other already know about it
