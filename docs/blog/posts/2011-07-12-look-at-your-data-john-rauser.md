While I couldn't make it to this year's O'Reilly Velocity 2011 I'm excited so
the videos are available to watch for free. My favourite talk from last year
was John Rauser's "[TCP and the Lower Bound of Web
Performance](/2010/07/tcp-and-the-lower-bound-of-web-performance/)".

This year John delivered an excellent talk entitled *look at your data*. He
demonstrated how looking at averages hides a lot of what's really going on and
identifies how toolmakers might improve their offerings.

> Modern monitoring software makes it easy to plot a statistic like average
> latency every minute -- too easy. Fancy dashboards of time series plots often
> lull us into a false sense of security. Underneath every point on those plots
> is a distribution, and underneath that distribution is a series of
> individuals: your customers.
