I'm a massive fan of [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/)'s command line
virtualisation goodness. This post is me trying to find a public place for my
vagrant notes to rest (I couldn't find a cardboard box).

### [vagrant-hostmaster](https://github.com/mosaicxm/vagrant-hostmaster)

This vagrant rubygem plugin automatically updates /etc/hosts on your guests and
host box each time you run vagrant [up|provision]

### [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest)

_vagrant-vbguest_ is a [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) plugin which
automatically installs the host's VirtualBox Guest Additions on the guest
system.
