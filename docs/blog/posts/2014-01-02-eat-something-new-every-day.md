On [Redesign My Brain][], Todd Sampson took on the challenge of eating something
new each day in order to get his brain working more creatively. I decided to try
this as well to see if I notice any changes to my thinking.

Fruit seems like an obvious place to start for me as I only eat three of them: apples, bananas and mandarins.

## Jan

01 Kiwifruit # I solved the kiwifruit for myself.
02 Apricot   # I cheated and watched [a walkthrough][]. Do you eat the skin?
