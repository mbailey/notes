I was fortunate enough to be in the room for this talk by John Rauser at [Velocity 2010](http://en.oreilly.com/velocity2010). I realized a few minutes in that this talk was (a) super interesting and (b) not being filmed. So I pulled out my [Flip](http://www.theflip.com/) and caught most of it.

This talk inspired me to [plot some real world data](2010-07-09-latency-is-a-killer.md) to test the theory.

The [slides from the talk are here](http://bit.ly/9a0Bjv).
