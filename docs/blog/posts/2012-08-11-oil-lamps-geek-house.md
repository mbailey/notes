Of the five senses, the two I get most signal through are sight and hearing.
Over the past few weeks I've been experimenting with the former and have made
some interesting discoveries (or perhaps more correctly, rediscoveries). I have
no qualifications in lighting or biological science but think it's worth
sharing my experiences and a summary of what I've learned. I'd love to hear
from you (in the comments) if you find any of it interesting.

People's sensitivity to their environment varies greatly. I think I'm on the
more sensitive end of the spectrum and are more affected by:

  * [glare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glare_%28vision%29) - halogen down-lights, car headlights in the rear view mirror

  * [color temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature) - evening computer use, walking into convenience stores lit by fluorescent lights

  * [golden hour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_%28photography%29) - first/last hour of sunlight loved by photographers and film makers

  * firelight - candle, oil lamp, campfire


## The Lamp Shop

As a teen I went through a phase of lighting candles in my bedroom. The light
they produced created a different mood or atmosphere that I think most readers
will relate to. A few weeks ago when walking home from the Melbourne CBD I came
across a curious little lamp shop that would not have looked out of place a
century ago.

Established in 1918 and in Elizabeth Street from 1951 to 2004, T.W. Sands & Co
is one of the few original lamp houses left in the world.

T.W. Sands & Co has been selling oil and kerosene lamps for almost 100 years.
They never switched to electricity! Inside they sell new and old lamps, as well
as wicks, chimneys, oil and replacement parts. My curious mind lit up with
questions - fortunately the staff have a detailed knowledge of the workings of
the lamps along with the history of advancements in burner technology. In
short, the Americans won the arms race with the [40 candle power
Aladdin](http://www.aladdinlamps.com/) which is still in production today. This
uses a [thermoluminescent
mantle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoluminescence) that throws off a
bright white light when heated by the burner. They're so bright they require a
shade to reduce glare and while great for a dinner table I prefer my flames
naked.


## Oil Powered Time Machine

I returned the next day to buy three different types of lamp for my 1880's home
in Carlton North. The house sports three rather impressive fireplaces that
would have been the main source of heating when built. The mantle pieces seemed
like an obvious place to put the lamps. They stand at shoulder height and are a
foot deep which means the lamps:

  * are in an optimal position to light faces
  * illuminate the other things on the mantlepiece, creating a feature
  * probably most importantly, won't get knocked over by an arm or bag hanging from someone's shoulder

This last point is important. A number of people expressed alarm that I was
using firelight in my house, fearing an accident. While I don't think lamp oil
will burn on floorboards, a rug, curtains or other wick-like furnishing would
be happy to assist and I could imagine many a housefire was started by a lamp.
The clumsy and dim witted are probably better off in a fire free household. I'm
confident I can manage it though. Already I felt like I was defending something
that few would have worried about in the 1880s.

I decided to do a sort of [Earth Hour](http://www.earthhour.org/) on steroids,
abstaining from electric lighting for a week. The experience transported me
back to a time where the human experience of night time was very different to
what we know today. For someone with little practical experience using
firelight in a domestic environment I had to work things out for myself. This
was interesting from a historical perspective but also led to me learning more
about how our eyes work and the magic of night vision.

In some ways it felt like camping, perhaps because that's the only time I
experience the night without electric lights. For this experiment I had a
control - the house as I used it before - so I could identify what elements of
the experience were due to the lighting. This removed confounding variables
like country air, a long drive and kangaroos.


## Firelight Changes the User Interface of a Room

Back in the late 90's Google replaced Alta Vista as the search engine of choice.

One refreshing change was the lack of distractions on the Google's search page.

Modern home lighting is akin to flood lighting. The majority of homes have
overhead lighting without dimmers which results in reflected (and lots of it)
light being pretty evenly dispersed. Firelight is of lower intensity and so
highlights things in close proximity. You wouldn't clean the floors to
firelight - that's a job better left for the cold light of day. Similarly, it's
not as easy to check for mud on your boots in firelight. I wouldn't be
surprised if people we more inclined to leave them at the front door if they
came home after dark.

Low output lights seems to create less extraneous stimulus by creating more
focus on areas nearer the light source.


## Ow! My Eyes!

In addition to the lower intensity of firelight, it also gives has a much
warmer colour temperature. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the light
you're confronted with when visiting a convenience store lit
by fluorescent tubes.

Color Temperature is measured in Kelvin and strangely enough a lower value
refers to a warmer light. It refers to the temperature of a black body radiator
that emits a light of comparable hue. The 'cold light of day' is up there
with fluorescent tubes which might explain why walking into one at night can be
feel so unpleasant. Suddenly adjusting to a different color temperature seems
to be a bit jarring for some people.

| Temperature (K)         | Source |
| ------------------------| ------ |
| 1,700 | Match flame
| 1,850 | Candle flame, sunset/sunrise
| 2,700–3,300 | Incandescent lamps
| 3,000 | Soft White compact fluorescent lamps
| 3,200 | Studio lamps, photofloods, etc.
| 3,350 |  Studio "CP" light
| 4,100–4,150 |  Moonlight,[[2]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature#cite_note-1) [xenon arc lamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon_arc_lamp)
| 5,000 |  Horizon daylight
| 5,000 |  tubular fluorescent lamps or Cool White/Daylight compact fluorescent lamps (CFL)
| 5,500–6,000 |  Vertical daylight, electronic flash
| 6,500 |  Daylight, overcast
| 6,500–9,300 |  LCD or CRT screen
| 15,000–27,000 |  Clear blue northern sky

Golden Hour (sunset/sunrise) is well known to photographers and film makers for
whom light quality is critical. While factors such as smog can have an impact,
generally the light at this time has a color temperature closer to firelight. I
took to walking my dogs at this time and in addition to watching the sun light
up the clouds noticed the changes in the way it lights everything during that
time. It's also referred to as Magic Hour and I highly recommend it as a great
time to take a walk outside.

##  Night Vision

Walking the dogs at sunset led to a surprising discovery. On returning home I
needed to enter the house in the dark to light my lamps. (I'm pretty sure
people used to keep a hand lamp on the hall stand to make this task
easier/safer!). On returning home one evening I discovered I could navigate
reasonably well using just the light entering my windows from the night sky and
street lighting.

Like an anemone, night vision is super sensitive to disturbances, quick to
retreat and slow to return.

Firelight doesn't seem to blow away my night vision. When I walk out into the backyard I can see pretty well.


## How Low (Light) Can You Go

The idea that my eyes had a contrast ratio of 1000 but that I could potentially
sense across nine orders of magnitude led me to try to create a darkroom in my
house. In short I failed to stop all light from entering my living room. At
first it appears that the bin liners taped to the windows had worked but as my
adaptation progressed I could see lighter patches on the windows where the bin
liners were not doubled over. Reflected light from the ski was seeping through!

That said, the light getting in was not enough to allow me to see my hand in
front of my face - the quintessential measure of darkness. My hand was visible
if a held a lit cigarette close to it but not when I moved it a foot away. I
was amazed at how sensitive my eyes were to light in such a low light
environment. How much light does a lit cigarette emit? I would love to know if
that's been measured!

Looking around the room I could see what looked like light seeping under the
door. This light originated from the street, passed through the window in my
front door and then down a long hallway. It occurred to me that in this modern
era it's almost impossible to keep light out.

To Be Continued?
