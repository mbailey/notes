A search for [deprec on technorati](http://technorati.com/posts/tag/deprec) turned up [this job ad](https://web.archive.org/web/20080112211239/http://jobs.brajeshwar.com/2007/07/lead-web-developer-for-a-chennai-firm/) that listed "**Capistrano, Deprec, Monit**" among the desirable skills. It's motivating to see deprec being used so widely.
