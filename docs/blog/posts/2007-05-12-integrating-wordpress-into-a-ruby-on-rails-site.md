The first question you'll probably ask is why I didn't go with typo or
mephisto. While I have to admit I haven't tried them myself, I decided to use
WordPress based on the maturity of the software and size of the userbase. I
think this is a pragmatic choice for a piece of software I want to use on my
site.

WordPress has a nice feature packed management interface.  It also supports
themes and I found I could customize it to fit in with my site without editing
any of the files that come with the main distribution. This means I can
automate upgrading of WordPress when future versions (with security fixes) are
released.
