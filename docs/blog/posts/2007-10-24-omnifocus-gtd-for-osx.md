Being a fan of Dave Allen's personal productivity book "[Getting Things
Done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)", I was excited to hear
that The Omni Group are working on a tool I can use to implement this work-life
management method.

The author of kGTD (a GTD template for
[OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/) Pro) has
produced a fine [introductory screencast to
OmniFocus](http://downloads.extremesims.com/omnigroup/software/MacOSX/movies/OmniFocus/omnifocus_alpha_intro.mov).
This really explained what I needed to know to use the software.

To preview alpha versions of OmniFocus you need to [sign up to their mailing
list](http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/listinfo/omnifocus-beta-announce). A day
after doing so I got an email inviting me to test the software.

The application is still under heavy development but it looks great. I have
used kGTD in the past and liked it but found it a little clunky.
