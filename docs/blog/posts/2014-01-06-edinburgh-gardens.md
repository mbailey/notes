What happens when more 15,000 revellers converge on an inner city Melbourne
park to ring in the new year with no perimeter fencing, byo drugs/alcohol and
just 12 police officers on duty?

A potential horror story of violence and destruction didn't eventuate but
this hasn't stopped the media from describing it as such.

There are over different 15,000 versions of NYE in Edinburgh Gardens 2014 and I
suspect most people had a pretty fun time. The fact it turned out to be a
largely peaceful celebration despite the absence of any effective crowd
control seems both newsworthy and worthy of further discussion.

Reading between the lines, the night sounds a bit like a night at an open air
music festival like Meredith or Golden Plains. Events like these show us that
while we will never be completely rid of dickheads, most people want to be good
to each other.

Misrepresentation of the evening and villification it's participants has spread
righteous indignation far beyond residents of the parks gentrified surrounds.
Yarra Council is now facing increased pressure to crack down on park users.


## 'Trash'ing the Gardens

We were told the park was [trashed][]. While this brings thoughts of vandalism and
permanent damage, reporters were actually referring to litter, most of which
was all picked up and removed by Council staff and volunteers by sunset on 1
Jan.

Now don't get me wrong, there was a whole lot of litter. The place was a mess
but one man's trash is another man's treasure and the indignation inspiring
imagery was media gold for the evening news and daily papers.

Music festivals like Meredith and Golden Plains see attendees cleaning up the
mess from the night before when the sun rises.


## Fence Climbing

Climbing can be fun but the recently installed tennis court fences aren't very
strong. The top bars slipped under the weight of people climbing on them. The
Herald Sun reported this as [vandalism][tennis]. By these standards your
average two year old is a wanton vandal.

Meredith and Golden Plains are two music festivals where you can bring your own alcohol but have a strict NO GLASS POLICY.

There were two violent acts reported. A man lost several teeth when he was
[punched in the face][face punch] and a seventeen year old boy was arrested
after he allegedly [punched a female police officer][punch police] in the face.

I don't think anyone has worked out a solution to dickheads but MMF try:

> Festivals at the Meredith Supernatural Amphitheatre have a No Dickhead Policy.

> So if you are a Dickhead, this festival isn’t for you.

## Hey Rupert, Stop Bashing Our Youth

Demonising our youth may sell papers but what does it do to our social fabric?
Crafting words that stir up moral panic doesn't make life easier for anyone.

The sky is not falling and the connected generations are not falling for your lies.
