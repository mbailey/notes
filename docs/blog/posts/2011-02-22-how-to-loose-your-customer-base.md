_Yes, the misspelling in the title is deliberate. See image below._

If you're building expensive tools for managing server infrastructure, please
don't assume your users are idiots. Warning me about the possible consequences
of my action is fine. Preventing me from doing what I want to do won't endear
me to your product and poor spelling won't increase my confidence. I'm LOOSING
confidence in you VMware.
