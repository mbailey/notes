*[2013-12-18 Shankly disappeared in Feb 2012. I currently use Spotify]*

Have you stopped listening to new music? If you don't have cool "music seeker"
friends providing your aural fix then perhaps it's time you become that person.
If you're into the shit I'm into then you're in luck my friend. A fellow known
only as "Shankly" has been putting monthly compilations on the net for a few
years now. While much of it won't take your fancy, some of it might and that
can lead you to some great new music.


### Sounds Great, What Do I Do

  1. Download this months edition of ["Shanklys Mixtapes"](http://bit.ly/shankly_201104)
  1. Listen to the 80 tracks noting the ones you like
  1. Make a shortlist of albums to download. On a good month I find 5.
  1. After listening to the albums a few times, go buy the best ones.


### Doesn't That Make Me A Criminal?

Hey, how many albums did you buy last year? None? Because you don't know what to get?

What's criminal is that people don't know this stuff is out there. Why does
Radio and TV play absolute shit when there are true artists creating beautiful
music.

What's criminal is that no one told me how fucking amazing [Mogwai](http://www.subpop.com/releases/mogwai/full_lengths/hardcore_will_never_die_but_you_will) is. Till I heard them on [Shankly's Mixtape for Jan 2011](http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6142977/Shankly_s_2011_Mixtapes_-_January) that is.
