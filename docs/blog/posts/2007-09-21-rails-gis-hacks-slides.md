I'm excited by the  content of these [slides](http://www.railsconfeurope.com/presentations/railsconfeurope07/re7_burqrasul.pdf) from the [Rails GIS Hacks](http://www.railsconfeurope.com/cs/railseurope2007/view/e_sess/14212) talk given on Monday at RailsConf Europe. [Shoaib Burq](http://geospatial.nomad-labs.com/) and [Kashif Rasul](http://nomad-labs.com/) from [Nomad Labs](http://www.nomad-labs.com/) did an awesome job with their slides. I would love to see/hear their talk if anyone recorded it.

Update: Shoaib Burq has posted the very professional [tutorial notes](http://rails.nomad-labs.com/?page_id=7) online. This is the kind of PDF I would pay money for. Thanks for sharing it with us Shoaib!
