Web browsers don't tend to display JSON very nicely. See how yours does with
[this example](http://benhollis.net/software/jsonview/example.json). Some handy
plugins that help with this. While they currently only allow viewing, how long
before we se some PUT/POST action?

### [JSONView for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/jsonview/)

> Normally when encountering a JSON document (content type
> "application/json"), Firefox simply prompts you to download the file.  With
> the JSONView extension, JSON documents are shown in the browser  similar to
> how XML documents are shown. The document is formatted,  highlighted, and
> arrays and objects can be collapsed.  Even if the JSON  document contains
> errors, JSONView will still show the raw text.

There is also an [Unofficial JSONView port for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) and the [Unfortunately Named "XML View" for Safari](http://www.entropy.ch/software/MacOSX/xmlviewplugin/)

When installed, your JSON will look more like this:
