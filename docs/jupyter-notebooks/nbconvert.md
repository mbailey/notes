# nbconvert

Convert a Jupyter notebook to various formats, including markdown

Exporting all the markdown and code cells from a Jupyter notebook to a simple markdown file can be done in several ways. Here's a straightforward method using `nbconvert`, a tool that comes with Jupyter:

## Usage

`nbconvert` allows you to convert a Jupyter notebook to various formats, including markdown. To do this:

1. **Open a Terminal:** Open a command-line interface.

2. **Use the nbconvert Command:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     jupyter nbconvert --to markdown YourNotebook.ipynb [--no-output]
     ```
   - Replace `YourNotebook.ipynb` with the name of your notebook file.

3. **Result:**
   - This command will create a markdown file with the same name as your notebook in the same directory.
   - The generated markdown file will contain all the markdown and code cells from your notebook.

## Install

```shell
pip install nbconvert
```
### Customizing the Output

- If you need more customization, such as excluding code cells or including only markdown, you might need to use additional tools or write a custom script.
- For more complex requirements, you can explore Python scripts that read the notebook file (which is a JSON file) and extract the desired content.

### Note

- `nbconvert` will also convert output cells by default. If you only want the input cells (markdown and code) without outputs, you might need additional steps or custom scripting.
- Ensure that `nbconvert` is installed. It usually comes with the standard Jupyter installation, but if it's missing, you can install it using `pip install nbconvert`.

This method provides a quick and easy way to convert your entire notebook into a markdown document for documentation purposes.
