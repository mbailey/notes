# Human vs Language Model: Token Generation Speed

By Mike Bailey using Claude.ai
## Speed Comparison Table

| Method                         | Tokens per Second | Words per Minute (approx.) |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| LM (e.g., GPT-3)               | 60-100            | 2400-4000                   |
| Human (Fast Speaker)           | 7-9               | 180-220                     |
| Human (Fast Typist on Computer)| 4-5               | 100-125                     |
| Human (Avg. Texter on Phone)   | 0.5-1             | 35-40                       |

## Detailed Breakdown

### Written Language

- Human (fast typist on computer):
  - ~4-5 tokens per second
  - Limited by physical typing speed and thought composition

- Human (average texter on phone):
  - ~0.5-1 tokens per second
  - Based on average texting speed of 35-40 words per minute
  - Assumes average word length of 1.5 tokens

- Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-3):
  - ~60-100 tokens per second
  - Limited by computational power, not by "thinking" or composition time

### Spoken Language
- Human (fast speaker):
  - ~7-9 tokens per second
  - Based on ~180-220 words per minute for fast speakers
  - Assumes average word length of 1.5 tokens

- Large Language Model:
  - Same as written output (~60-100 tokens per second)
  - LMs don't distinguish between "spoken" and "written" output

## Key Differences

1. Speed Hierarchy: LM > Human Speaking > Human Typing > Human Texting
2. Consistency: LMs maintain speed, humans may vary or fatigue
3. Composition: Humans actively think and compose; LMs generate based on patterns
4. Modality: Humans have varying speeds for different modalities; LMs are consistent
5. Quality: Human output often more thoughtful, but LMs can produce coherent text rapidly
6. Device Impact: Phone texting significantly slower than computer typing for humans

Note: All figures are approximate and can vary based on individual skill, specific LM model, and content complexity.
