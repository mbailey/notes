# hashtag

- [hashtag (wikipedia.org)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag)

The use of hashtags was first proposed by American [blogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger "Blogger") and product consultant [Chris Messina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Messina_(open-source_advocate) "Chris Messina (open-source advocate)") in a 2007 tweet.

In June 2014, _hashtag_ was added to the _[Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary "Oxford English Dictionary")_ as "a word or phrase with the symbol _#_ in front of it, used on social media websites and apps so that you can search for all messages with the same subject".

The first published use of the term "hash tag" was in a blog post "Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings" by Stowe Boyd,[19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag#cite_note-19) on August 26, 2007, according to [lexicographer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicography "Lexicography") [Ben Zimmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Zimmer "Ben Zimmer"), chair of the [American Dialect Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dialect_Society "American Dialect Society")'s New Words Committee.
