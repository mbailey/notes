# Initial Setup

Here's a high-level list of the first things to do to secure and prepare a new Mac mini for running a publicly accessible service in production:

1. Update macOS and all software to the latest versions

2. Enable FileVault for full-disk encryption

3. Set up a strong administrator password

4. Configure the firewall and only allow necessary incoming connections

5. Install and configure antivirus software

6. Set up regular automated backups

7. Create a standard user account for day-to-day operations

8. Disable unnecessary services and remove unneeded software

9. Configure automatic software updates

10. Set up monitoring and logging tools

11. Implement a robust password policy

12. Configure screen lock and automatic logout

13. Disable unnecessary hardware (e.g., Bluetooth, if not needed)

14. Set up a VPN for remote administration

15. Review and configure sharing settings

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more detailed instructions for implementing them?
