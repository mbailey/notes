# Markdown Lists

Example list showing **Key:** in bold, followed by a value

- **Key:** Value
- **Another Key:** Another value


In lists, especially those formatted with colons, the part before the colon is referred to as the "key," "term," or "label," and the part after the colon is known as the "value," "definition," or "description." This format is commonly used for defining terms, explaining concepts, or listing properties and their corresponding details. The "key" introduces the concept or item, while the "value" provides more specific information or elaborates on the key.
