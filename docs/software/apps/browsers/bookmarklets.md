# Bookmarklets

Bookmarklets are powerful tools that can greatly enhance your web browsing experience. With a simple click, they bring efficiency and customisation right to your fingertips.

## What is a Bookmarklet?

A bookmarklet is a small software application stored as a bookmark in a web browser. Unlike traditional bookmarks that take you to a specific webpage, bookmarklets perform a function, like modifying the appearance of a webpage, extracting data, or integrating with external services. They are typically written in JavaScript and can be executed on any page you're viewing in your browser.

## Why Use Bookmarklets?

Bookmarklets are incredibly useful for automating repetitive tasks, enhancing web browsing efficiency, and adding custom functionality to your browsing experience. They are lightweight, easy to install, and can be used across multiple browsers. From simplifying complex actions with a single click to adding new features to your favourite websites, bookmarklets are versatile tools for any web user.

## How to Install a Bookmarklet

1. **Open Your Web Browser:** Start by launching the browser where you want the bookmarklet.

2. **Show Bookmarks Bar:** Make sure the bookmarks bar is visible. Enable it in the browserâ€™s settings or use a shortcut like `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Windows/Linux) or `Command+Shift+B` (Mac).

3. **Create a New Bookmark:**
   - Right-click on the bookmarks bar and select "Add page," "New bookmark," or a similar option.
   - In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your bookmarklet.
   - In the URL field, paste the JavaScript code of the bookmarklet. This code should start with `javascript:`.

4. **Save the Bookmarklet:** Click "Save" or "Add" to store the bookmarklet on your bookmarks bar.

5. **Using the Bookmarklet:** To use it, simply click on the bookmarklet whenever you're on a webpage where you want its functionality. The bookmarklet will run immediately, performing its coded action on the current page.
