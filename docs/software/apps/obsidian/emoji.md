# Emoji in Obsidian

By claude-3-5-sonnet - 2024-12-29 16:57:47 +11:00 Sun

In Obsidian, there are several ways to easily add emojis:

1. Built-in keyboard shortcuts:
- Windows: `Windows key + .` (period)
- Mac: `Command + Control + Space`
- Linux: `Control + .` (period) or `Super + .` (period)

2. Community Plugins:
- Install "Emoji Toolbar" plugin from Community Plugins
- Adds an emoji picker button to your editor
- Can be triggered with customizable hotkey

3. Text expansion:
- Some users use `:` shortcuts like `:smile:` 
- Requires additional plugins/setup

Would you like me to:
1. Show how to install and configure the Emoji Toolbar plugin?
2. Show different emoji shortcut options?
3. Explain how to customize emoji shortcuts?

The Emoji Toolbar plugin is probably the most convenient option for Obsidian specifically.
