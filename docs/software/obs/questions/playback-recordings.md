# Can I playback recordings within OBS?

Yes, you can playback recordings from within OBS Studio using the "Media Source" feature:

1. In OBS, click the + button under Sources
2. Select "Media Source" 
3. Create a new source or select an existing one
4. Click "Browse" and select your recording file
5. Configure playback options as needed:
   - Loop
   - Restart when activated
   - Local file
   - etc.
6. Click OK to add the media source

The recording will now be available as a source that you can play back within your OBS scenes.

Note: This method plays the recording as a source in your scenes. To simply review a recording without adding it to a scene, use your system's default media player to open the recording file in your OBS recordings folder.
