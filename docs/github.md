> Within an issue, you can use task lists to break work into smaller tasks and
> track the full set of work to completion. If a task requires further tracking or
> discussion, you can convert the task to an issue by hovering over the task and
> clicking target in the upper-right corner of the task. For more information, see ["About
> task lists."](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-issues/about-task-lists)
