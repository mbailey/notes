I decided to learn how to make super awesome eyecandy ruby slides in Keynote. I love presentations that include code samples and want to be able to make mine look good with as little effort as possible.</p> <p>First I installed a Textmate bundle called Copy as     RTF that copies a selection to the clipboard while preserving syntax highlighting and optimizing font size for pasting into Keynote.</p> <p>Then I found the ultimate pretty font (slides 14 + 15) but can't work out it is. I tried all the fonts on my MacBookPro to no avail. Then it occurred to me that I want a fixed width font to display code. And my Mac has only four of them: Monaco (which is the default for textmate), Courier, Courier new and Andale Mono.</p> <p></p> <p>So what font have they used?</p> <p>update - I found the font! It's Sunday night and I decided to have another crack at matching the font. Adobe Reader lists the fonts used under 'Document Properties'. There's a Textmate page listing alternative fonts. Guess what? BitstreamVeraSans and DejaVuSans are listed in both the document properties and the list of free fonts! I installed both and I reckon the winner is DejaVuSans-mono (download).</p> <p>I got my Apple MacBookPro using this font by copying it to /System/Library/Fonts.</p> <p>update 2 I had a problem with CopyasRTF. When pasting onto a black background in Keynote, all white text is turned black.

Now, a number of people have been asking if deprec will support other linux distro's (and even other OS's!). While I'm not interested in implementing them myself (until I get sick of Ubuntu) I love freedom so decided to extract all Ubuntu specific functionality into a plugin and allow others to write their own plugins.</p> <p>You can now write a plugin that will be loaded automatically by deprec2 with no manual intervention or configuration required by the user. Follow the tutorial on the gem_plugin site but here's the core of it:</p> <pre><code>  setup_gem(name, version) do |spec|\n    spec.summary = \"The deprec_ubuntu GemPlugin\"\n    spec.description = spec.summary\n    spec.author=\"Mike Bailey\"\n    spec.add_dependency('gem_plugin', '&gt;= 0.2.2')\n    spec.add_dependency('deprec', '&gt;= 2.0.0')\n    spec.files += Dir.glob(\"resources/**/*\")\n  end\n</code></pre> <p>Make your gem dependent on gem_plugin and deprec. The way this works is clever. When deprec starts, it requires gem_plugin which goes and looks through the other locally installed gems. If it finds any gems that have gem_plugin and deprec as dependencies, it loads their init.rb file.</p> <p>So installed a third party plugin to support a new distro for deprec be as simple as:</p> <pre><code>sudo gem install deprec_beos\n</code></pre> <p>Note: I'm still hacking on deprec2 - hoping for a preview release this week!</p>"},{"location":"blog/2007/07/10/vim-syntax-highlighting-for-rails/","title":"Vim Syntax Highlighting for Rails","text":"<p>A couple of days I updated the font settings in terminal.app on my mac.

He spent a lot of time extolling the virtues of Make and how useful it can be in automating sysadmin tasks. Rails makes good use of Rake (think 'ruby-make') to specify administrative tasks. Make/Rake let you specify dependencies in your tasks and by checking file timestamps you can avoid running tasks unnecessarily. This has given me an idea for a change to the way deprec works.</p> <p>It would be nice if I could restart mongrel on the server using the same command as I use in Capistrano. I'm not suggesting using Rake from my workstation but rather to have many of deprecs cap tasks call a Rake task on the server. So 'cap deprec:mongrel:restart' would call 'rake deprec:mongrel:restart' on the server(s).</p> <p>There would be two main benefits to this.</p> <p>Firstly, all deprec tasks would be available from the command line on the target host (obviously some bootstrapping would be required to install Rake, Ruby, etc initially). While I prefer not to have to log in manually to each of the servers in a cluster, there are times when I'm logged in and would like to be able to run tasks locally.</p> <p>A second benefit is that we could take advantage of dependencies. Compiling PHP, after Apache has already been installed, will no longer cause Apache to be recompiled. Installing Subversion, when Apache has not already been installed, will cause it to be installed. This will reduce the amount of time tasks take to run (which is non-trivial when it involves compiling the likes of openssl!)</p> <p>Back in May 2007, Bradley Taylor of Railsmachine released a nice gem called Machinify. It's a set of Rake tasks that will install a Rails stack on Ubuntu. It's very nicely written and quite readable. I considered whether I should make deprec dependent on Machinify but as it lacks some of the tasks I want (install, nginx, postgres, etc) I think it would be better for deprec come with its own Rake tasks.</p> <p>So, it's very tempting to re-architect deprec2 but another thing to consider is this: would we be better off with a working deprec2 next week or a re-designed deprec2 at some later point? I think working code is a better result than ideas that won't get implemented in the available timeframe.</p> <p>One issue with calling remote rake tasks via Cap is dealing with interactive dialogs. deprec currently deals with this by listening for certain output from the remote call. I can't see why deprec couldn't simply call the remote rake task and listen for the same output. This would allow deprec tasks to be extracted into rake tasks.</p> <p>So my current thinking is to press on with deprec2 development and then extract the tasks into Rake tasks at some future point.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2007/10/24/omnifocus-gtd-for-osx/","title":"OmniFocus - GTD for OSX","text":"<p>Being a fan of Dave Allen's personal productivity book \"Getting Things Done\", I was excited to hear that The Omni Group are working on a tool I can use to implement this work-life management method.</p> <p>The author of kGTD (a GTD template for OmniOutliner Pro) has produced a fine introductory screencast to OmniFocus.

It was a perfect candidate for fingerprinting support as it generates resource URLs from stored data.</p> <p>Enabling it is as simple as:</p> <ol> <li>Install paperclip-2.3.4</li> <li>Add an :attachment_fingerprint column to your database</li> <li>Include :fingerprint in the path for your attachment (see below)</li> </ol> <pre><code>has_attached_file :avatar,\n  :styles =&gt; { :medium =&gt; \"300x300&gt;\", :thumb =&gt; \"100x100&gt;\" },\n  :path =&gt; \"users/:id/:attachment/:fingerprint-:style.:extension\",\n  :storage =&gt; :s3,\n  :s3_headers =&gt; {'Expires' =&gt; 1.year.from_now.httpdate},\n  :s3_credentials =&gt; \"#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/s3.yml\",\n  :use_timestamp =&gt; false&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This enables us to set far future expire headers so that browsers don't need to check for a newer version. If a change does occur, say because a user uploads a new avatar, the new filename will be rendered in your html and the cached version will be ignored.</p> <p>The example above will set Expires headers in S3. If you're using local storage you can configure your webserver to do something similar.</p> <p>We disable the timestamped query string because some proxies refuse to cache items with query strings.</p> <p>Fingerprinting support was added to paperclip-2.3.4 on 6 Oct 2010.</p> <p>For more info on optimizing for caching:</p> <p>http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/caching.html</p>"},{"location":"blog/2010/06/11/chrome-is-most-popular-browser/","title":"Chrome is Most Popular Browser!","text":"<p>At least amongst visitors to my blog yesterday.</p> <p></p> <p>And no, I don't normally get 240 visitors to this blog but I'd just made an announcement that obviously appealed to people with good taste in browsers!</p>"},{"location":"blog/2010/07/02/speed-matters/","title":"Speed Matters","text":"<p>Last week I lucky enough to attend O'Reilly Velocity 2010. In the heart of Silicon Valley, 1200 geeks assembled to discuss how we can make the web faster. We listened to techies from Amazon, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Firefox, Firebug, Chrome, and more talking about web performance and operations. The trip was worth it. Check out the videos.</p> <p>Last night I had the opportunity to present a little of what I've learned about Web Performance to the Melbourne Ruby User Group. It's clear from feedback that we care about reducing page load times and most of us have used performance analysers like YSlow. Folks appreciated metrics from Google, Amazon and Wikia that show a small difference in page load time (100ms) affects sales, abandonment and conversions. This kind of thing helps us make a business case to employers and clients for speeding up the web.</p> <p>Australia is a \"special place\" network wise. The insane cost of bandwidth and services means many of us choose cheap hosting in the U.S. even when the majority of our users are in Australia. This means choosing increasing latency from ~20ms to &gt;200ms. Latency affects TCP performance even more than most of us would guess. I'm currently looking into just how big a difference this makes.</p> <p>Which leads to the next question, where are the great VPS and DNS services in Aus?

Cooperation has given survival advantages to our species. One interesting aspect of our wiring is empathy. It's been argued that this involves mirror neurons, which fire both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another. Whatever the cause, we feel other peoples feelings and therefore share in the benefits when we make someone feel better. Conversely, causing someone distress should give us unpleasant feelings. This seems like a simple yet effective system for social regulation that doesn't require modern (human) innovations like verbal language, law or religion.</p> <p>So how can people still be cruel to other people if they're going to feel their emotions? Did we evolve a way to selectively shutdown this mechanism? If your tribe was under attack, surely it would be advantageous if your warriors could suppress empathic responses just long enough to beat your enemies to a pulp. You would want them to be re-enabled once the threat has gone though!</p> <p>I think we have built in empathy circuit breakers that get activated when we see people we dislike. There may be other ways to suppress empathy such as \"just following orders\" but it's the identification of people as bad or an enemy that has me curious. Is this a major contributor to cruelty and callousness from otherwise kind individuals? Do we become 'selectively psychopathic' by shutting down an important part our 'humanity'?</p> <p>Some advice I always had trouble comprehending was \"love your enemies\". It may turn out to be another way of saying, \"don't disable your empathic mechanisms\". While this may not be helpful advice for a soldier on a battlefield, it's probably good advice for us in our schools, workplaces and social gatherings.</p> <p>I suspect a way to achieve this is not view anyone you deal with as 'bad guys' which reminds me of another quote attributed to Jesus, \"Do not judge others\".</p> <p></p> <p>There seems to be a fair bit of research going into modulation of empathic responses. I suspect there's a significant difference between the response of males and females to seeing a person being punished for wrongdoing. In the TV show The Shield, it's made very clear to you who the bad guy is in each episode and he usually gets a pounding by the end of it. My dad used to enjoy shows like The Professionals when I was a kid but my mum found the violence distressing. I wonder whether males, being the ones who probably had to defend the camp, developed the ability to 'reverse the polarity' on their empathic circuits and actually gain pleasure from seeing 'bad guys' suffer?</p> <p>Perhaps avoiding the human tendency to judge others unfavourably can help us avoid triggering a survival mechanism which doesn't have a place in modern society and in doing so, allow us to act better toward one another.</p> <p>Jesus must have given this a lot of thought.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2011/03/15/ssh-compression-can-slow-you-down/","title":"SSH compression can slow you down","text":"<p>Repost from my old blog</p> <p>When copying some large files between hosts at our rack I noticed some pretty poor transfer speeds.

The waiting list for new VPS's was stretching out to weeks when they came up with a novel solution. If you were willing to prepay for future months service you could move further up the queue. I can recall when paying for 6 months in advance would give you a server same day. It solved their cash flow problem and allowed them to buy more hardware.</p> <p>The following year they explained the downside to this approach. The tax office saw all the prepayments as income and wanted them to pay tax on them but saw their expenditure on servers as capital expenses which could only be depreciated over several years.

I don't know it that well yet so I'm not qualified to speak about it with any degree of authority. The idea of running rvm on production servers seems wrong to me because it seems to dump a load of non-standard complexity onto sysadmins while ignoring the unix idioms and conventions they know.</p> <p>Do we really need to be so specific about versions?</p> <p>In an age of virtualisation and cloud computing, a production server probably shouldn't need to have more than one version of Ruby installed. RVM makes it easy for devs to specify that this web app uses\u00a0ruby-1.9.2-p180 while that one uses\u00a0ruby-1.9.2-p290. I'm just not sure they should be expecting operations to be providing them with such specificity.</p> <p>Don't sysadmins have enough to deal with already?</p> <p>Developers may spend months or years in the same cosy environment working on software they know backwards.\u00a0Sysadmins deal with chaos everyday. They put out fires, multitask and deal with hundreds of different bits of software. What makes this possible is conventions within the unix world. Logs go here, start scripts there, this is the library load path, etc... System administration can be like working in a busy kitchen. Special off menu orders make their work harder and are not appreciated!</p> <p>I just wonder whether developers demanding specific Ruby patch levels will come across like the folks ordering coffee from LA Story?</p> <p>[Update] I was running into a few difficulties using RVM so at least for now, I've settled on a very simple use for RVM on my workstation. Bundler does a great job managing my gems so I've set RVM to use system Ruby and I'll only use a .rvmrc in projects that are not using my default of ruby-1.9.2.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2011/07/31/lost-dogs-home-cry-poor/","title":"Lost Dogs Home Cry Poor","text":"<p>[Update] The ABC have acknowledged that the Lost Dogs Home does actually get funding from government.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2011/07/31/lost-dogs-home-cry-poor/#lost-dogs-home-receive-millions-from-government","title":"Lost Dogs Home Receive Millions from Government","text":"<p>You're possibly already funding The Lost Dogs Home through your Council rates.

The house sports three rather impressive fireplaces that would have been the main source of heating when built. The mantle pieces seemed like an obvious place to put the lamps. They stand at shoulder height and are a foot deep which means the lamps:</p> <ul> <li>are in an optimal position to light faces</li> <li>illuminate the other things on the mantlepiece, creating a feature</li> <li>probably most importantly, won't get knocked over by an arm or bag hanging from someone's shoulder</li> </ul> <p>This last point is important. A number of people expressed alarm that I was using firelight in my house, fearing an accident. While I don't think lamp oil will burn on floorboards, a rug, curtains or other wick-like furnishing would be happy to assist and I could imagine many a housefire was started by a lamp. The clumsy and dim witted are probably better off in a fire free household. I'm confident I can manage it though.\u00a0Already I felt like I was defending something that few would have worried about in the 1880s.</p> <p></p> <p>I decided to do a sort of\u00a0Earth Hour\u00a0on steroids, abstaining from electric lighting for a week. The experience transported me back to a time where the human experience of night time was very different to what we know today. For someone with little practical experience using firelight in a domestic environment I had to work things out for myself. This was interesting from a historical perspective but also led to me learning more about how our eyes work and the magic of night vision.</p> <p>In some ways it felt like camping, perhaps because that's the only time I experience the night without electric lights. For this experiment I had a control - the house as I used it before - so I could identify what elements of the experience were due to the lighting.

The Answer Could Change Everything (purewow.com)</li> </ul> <p>What is Ask vs. Guess Culture?</p> <p>Coined in a 2007 blog post by Andrea Donderi in response to a question very similar to the example above, Donderi explains, \u201cIn some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture.\u201d In Guess Culture, Donderi writes, \u201cyou avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.\u201d</p> <p>What happens when an Asker collides with a Guesser?</p> <p>A thoughtful Asker will make a request believing the person they ask has the control to say no. A Guesser, however, thinks such a request is pushy and even borderline manipulative\u2014\u201cHow could I possibly say no even if this request is completely inconvenient for me?\u201d is how a Guesser thinks. This snowballs into a passive aggressive avalanche that is absolutely toxic for relationships. And that applies to all relationships\u2014an employee asking a manager for a raise, a child asking permission to have a sleepover or even a woman asking her partner to change the channel.</p> <p>Why knowing if you\u2019re an Asker or Guesser is useful</p> <p>It\u2019s really, really hard to change something that\u2019s part of how we grow up. The Ask and Guess culture of the home you were raised in is deeply nuanced and more often than not, completely unconscious. But there\u2019s also larger cultural influences at play. Oliver Burkeman writes in The Guardian, \u201cThis is a\u00a0spectrum, not a dichotomy, and it explains cross-cultural awkwardnesses, too: Brits and Americans get discombobulated doing business in Japan, because it's a Guess culture, yet experience Russians as rude, because they're diehard Askers.\u201d</p> <p>So, just as it benefits an American doing business in Japan to understand the seemingly subtle differences between Askers and Guessers, it also benefits individuals in their everyday relationships. Why did Donna get so rigid after she agreed to let Ray borrow her car? How could Ray be so thoughtless, assuming Donna has nothing going on in her life?! If you take a step back, you can see exactly how the dynamic unfolds. Donna, a Guesser, believes she can\u2019t say no if the request is made because she would never ask such a thing directly. And Ray, an Asker, sees no problem in making the request. If Donna can identify herself as a Guesser and Ray as an Asker, she can be more empowered to say how she really feels. And if Ray knows that he\u2019s an outspoken Asker, he can navigate his requests more gingerly.</p> <p>Are You an Asker or a Guesser?

A managed identity is simply some Microsoft-managed automation on top of an Azure AD service principal, which is best explained as a security principal used for non-humans. One of the primary benefits managed identities provider over traditional service principals is automatic credential rotation.

The key components are in both files:</p> <ol> <li> <p>In <code>aider/models.py</code>, the <code>Model</code> class sets <code>max_chat_history_tokens</code> based on the model's context window: <pre><code>max_input_tokens = self.info.get(\"max_input_tokens\") or 0\nif max_input_tokens &lt; 32 * 1024:\n    self.max_chat_history_tokens = 1024\nelse:\n    self.max_chat_history_tokens = 2 * 1024\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>In <code>aider/history.py</code>, the <code>ChatSummary</code> class handles summarizing chat history when it gets too large:</p> </li> <li>It takes a <code>max_tokens</code> parameter (defaulting to 1024) </li> <li>Uses <code>too_big()</code> to check if messages exceed the token limit</li> <li>Has a <code>summarize()</code> method that recursively breaks down and summarizes chat history to fit within the token limit</li> </ol> <p>The basic flow is: 1. Model's max chat history is set to either 1024 or 2048 tokens depending on context window 2. When restoring chat history, if it exceeds the limit:    - Messages are split into chunks    - Older messages are summarized recursively     - Recent messages are kept verbatim    - This continues until the entire history fits within the token limit</p> <p>To see the complete flow of chat history restoration, we should also look at where <code>ChatSummary</code> is used. Could you share the file that handles the <code>--restore-chat-history</code> flag? Tokens: 13k sent, 316 received.

It     is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.

The character \"?\" matches any one character except \"/\". The range notation, e.g.     [a-zA-Z], can be used to match one of the characters in a range.

For example, \"a/**/b\" matches \"a/b\",     \"a/x/b\", \"a/x/y/b\" and so on.</p> <p>\u2022   Other consecutive asterisks are considered regular asterisks and will match according to the previous rules.</p>"},{"location":"notes/software/git/git-lfs/","title":"git-lfs","text":""},{"location":"notes/software/git/git-lfs/#lfs","title":"lfs","text":"<pre><code>git lfs ls-files --all\n</code></pre> <p>Remove from lfs</p> <pre><code>git lfs untrack '&lt;file-type&gt;'\ngit rm --cached '&lt;file-type&gt;'\ngit add '&lt;file-type&gt;'\ngit commit -m \"restore '&lt;file-type&gt;' to git from lfs\"\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"notes/software/git/git-lfs/#see-also","title":"See also","text":"<ul> <li>https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2021/05/12/why-you-shouldn%27t-use-git-lfs/<ul> <li>performance</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/software/git/git-main-master/","title":"Change default branch  from main to master","text":"<p>Remembering whether default branch is <code>master</code> or <code>main</code> can be taxing.</p>"},{"location":"notes/software/git/git-main-master/#update-github","title":"Update GitHub","text":"<p>Update on GitHub.com: Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Default branch</p>"},{"location":"notes/software/git/git-main-master/#update-local-repositories","title":"Update local repositories","text":"<pre><code>git branch -m main &lt;BRANCH&gt;\ngit fetch origin\ngit branch -u origin/&lt;BRANCH&gt; &lt;BRANCH&gt;\ngit remote set-head origin -a\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"notes/software/git/git-submodules/","title":"Git submodules","text":"<ul> <li>Git - Submodules (git-scm.com)</li> </ul> <p>Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository.
