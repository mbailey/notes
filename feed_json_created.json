Duration is measured in GB-seconds which is why it's\npossible to reduce your cost by reducing the maximum memory provided to you\nlambdas.</p>\n<p>You specify an amount between 128 MB and 3,008 MB in 64 MB increments. Lambda\nallocates CPU power linearly in proportion to the amount of memory configured.\nAt 1,792 MB, a function has the equivalent of 1 full vCPU (one vCPU-second of\ncredits per second).</p>\n<p>There are situations where provisioning far more memory than will be used is a\ngood choice. If the function is CPU bound (as opposed to waiting on responses\nfrom the network) then increasing CPU will reduce duration, improving\nperformance without negatively impacting on cost.</p>\n<p>The risk when setting memory for a Lambda is that execution halts immediately\nif the function runs out of memory. Changes to the function over time may alter\nit's memory usage so we're best to monitor and alert on this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"checking-memory-usage\">Checking Memory Usage<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#checking-memory-usage\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>It's relatively simple to report on the maximum memory being used by\na lambda.

The report shows it had 976 MB memory and used\nat most 275 MB in the past three days. Note that the sample query returns\nfigures that may be confusing due to them using a different unit (MiB) than is\nused for configuring Lambda functions (MB).

Sands, Melbourne (1918-2018)\" src=\"../../../../images/2012-08-11-oil-lamps-geek-house/lamp_shop.jpeg\" /></a></p>\n<p>As a teen I went through a phase of lighting candles in my bedroom. The light\nthey produced created a different mood or atmosphere that I think most readers\nwill relate to. A few weeks ago when walking home from the Melbourne CBD I came\nacross a curious little lamp shop that would not have looked out of place a\ncentury ago.</p>\n<p>Established in 1918 and in Elizabeth Street from 1951 to 2004, T.W. Sands &amp; Co\nis one of the few original lamp houses left in the world.</p>\n<p>T.W. Sands &amp; Co has been selling oil and kerosene lamps for almost 100 years.\nThey never switched to electricity! Inside they sell new and old lamps, as well\nas wicks, chimneys, oil and replacement parts. My curious mind lit up with\nquestions - fortunately the staff have a detailed knowledge of the workings of\nthe lamps along with the history of advancements in burner technology. In\nshort, the Americans won the arms race with the <a href=\"http://www.aladdinlamps.com/\">40 candle power\nAladdin</a> which is still in production today. This\nuses a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoluminescence\">thermoluminescent\nmantle</a> that throws off a\nbright white light when heated by the burner. They're so bright they require a\nshade to reduce glare and while great for a dinner table I prefer my flames\nnaked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"oil-powered-time-machine\">Oil Powered Time Machine<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#oil-powered-time-machine\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>I returned the next day to buy three different types of lamp for my 1880's home\nin Carlton North. The house sports three rather impressive fireplaces that\nwould have been the main source of heating when built. The mantle pieces seemed\nlike an obvious place to put the lamps. They stand at shoulder height and are a\nfoot deep which means the lamps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>are in an optimal position to light faces</li>\n<li>illuminate the other things on the mantlepiece, creating a feature</li>\n<li>probably most importantly, won't get knocked over by an arm or bag hanging from someone's shoulder</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This last point is important. A number of people expressed alarm that I was\nusing firelight in my house, fearing an accident. While I don't think lamp oil\nwill burn on floorboards, a rug, curtains or other wick-like furnishing would\nbe happy to assist and I could imagine many a housefire was started by a lamp.\nThe clumsy and dim witted are probably better off in a fire free household. I'm\nconfident I can manage it though.\u00a0Already I felt like I was defending something\nthat few would have worried about in the 1880s.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"the time machine\" src=\"../../../../images/2012-08-11-oil-lamps-geek-house/the_time_machine_large_01-1-300x256.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>I decided to do a sort of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.earthhour.org/\">Earth Hour</a>\u00a0on steroids,\nabstaining from electric lighting for a week. The experience transported me\nback to a time where the human experience of night time was very different to\nwhat we know today. For someone with little practical experience using\nfirelight in a domestic environment I had to work things out for myself. This\nwas interesting from a historical perspective but also led to me learning more\nabout how our eyes work and the magic of night vision.</p>\n<p>In some ways it felt like camping, perhaps because that's the only time I\nexperience the night without electric lights. For this experiment I had a\ncontrol - the house as I used it before - so I could identify what elements of\nthe experience were due to the lighting. This removed confounding variables\nlike country air, a long drive and kangaroos.</p>\n<h2 id=\"firelight-changes-the-user-interface-of-a-room\">Firelight Changes the User Interface of a Room<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#firelight-changes-the-user-interface-of-a-room\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h2>\n<p>Back in the late 90's Google replaced Alta Vista as the search engine of choice.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Alta Vista got 'busy'\" src=\"../../../../images/2012-08-11-oil-lamps-geek-house/AltaVista-HOME-280x300.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>One refreshing change was the lack of distractions on the Google's search page.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Google's distraction free interface\" src=\"../../../../images/2012-08-11-oil-lamps-geek-house/Google-300x183.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Modern home lighting is akin to flood lighting. The majority of homes have\noverhead lighting without dimmers which results in reflected (and lots of it)\nlight being pretty evenly dispersed. Firelight is of lower intensity and so\nhighlights things in close\u00a0proximity. You wouldn't clean the floors to\nfirelight - that's a job better left for the cold light of day. Similarly, it's\nnot as easy to check for mud on your boots in firelight. I wouldn't be\nsurprised if people we more inclined to leave them at the front door if they\ncame home after dark.</p>\n<p>Low output lights seems to create less extraneous stimulus by creating more\nfocus on areas nearer the light source.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ow-my-eyes\">Ow!
