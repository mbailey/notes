# What's this?

Things I don't want to rely on google/my memory for.

Markdown files, published to [https://mike.bailey.net.au/notes](https://mike.bailey.net.au/notes).

*I manage my notes with vim and [`notes.sh`](https://github.com/mbailey/notes/blob/master/notes.sh) which provides:*

- bash completion
- create missing notes
- separate public / work / personal repos
